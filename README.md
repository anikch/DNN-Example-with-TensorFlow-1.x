# DNN-Example-with-TensorFlow-1.x
Building a deep neural network using TensorFlow 1.x for binary classification.

1. The dataset has two features('feature1' and 'feature2') and one target variable.
2. The target variable(named as 'class') maps each record to either 0 or 1.
3. We'll first check if data is Linearly separable or not
4. We'll then check the performance of Logistic Regression.
5. Then We'll be building a deep neural network using tensorflow for binary classification.
